Computer science
It takes 5.4 seconds to run the query initially. Our dictionary that holds all the values and docid is way too large, it takes 5.2 seconds to iterate through all of them. Now we limit the amount of values for each query at 20 and the query takes around 300 ms.

Information and Computer Science
It takes 0.5 seconds for this query to run. We ordered the query words in order of importance to reduce the amount of docids in the set to make it run faster.

Irvine
The previous process breaks the query for one single word, fixing the issue. Query done in 0.03 seconds
